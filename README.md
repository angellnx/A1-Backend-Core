A1 Backend Core is the backend foundation for a **personal finance and investment management system** designed to help individuals better understand and control their financial activity.

The platform is being developed with a particular focus on **low and middle-income users**, who often lack access to accessible financial tools that help them organize their finances and identify harmful financial habits.

# 💡 Why This Project Exists

In Brazil and across the world, millions of people struggle not only with limited income — but with the absence of tools that help them understand their own financial reality.

For low and middle-income individuals, financial stress is often invisible: small daily expenses that accumulate unnoticed, harmful spending habits that are never identified, and financial decisions made without clarity or support. The result is a cycle that is difficult to break — not because people lack effort or discipline, but because they lack access.

Accessible financial tools have historically been designed for those who already have financial stability. Everyone else is left behind.

This project was born from the belief that **technology can change that**.

A1 Backend Core is the technical foundation for a platform that aims to give people — regardless of their income level — the visibility, organization, and awareness they need to take control of their financial lives.

The goal is not just to build a good API. The goal is to build infrastructure that supports tools capable of making a real difference in people's lives.

# 🎯 The Impact We Want to Create

Financial organization should not be a privilege.

This platform is being built to support tools that help people:

* Understand where their money is going — clearly and without complexity
* Identify spending habits that damage their financial health
* Track income and expenses in a simple and accessible way
* Make more informed financial decisions over time
* Build healthier financial habits gradually and sustainably

The long-term vision is a platform that reaches people who have never had access to structured financial guidance — and gives them the same visibility and control that has always been available only to those who could afford it.

Every architectural decision in this project — from how transactions are structured to how data is protected — is made with this mission in mind.

---

# 🧠 Core Concept

The system is designed around **financial transactions**.

Each transaction is associated with a user, an item, and a transaction type. The transaction type carries an `is_positive` flag that determines whether the value represents an income or an expense.

To simplify data entry, the API automatically normalizes transaction values. Users always provide **positive values**, and the system determines the correct sign internally.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "item_id": 1,
  "transaction_type_name": "Expense",
  "value": 200
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "value": -200,
  "transaction_type_name": "Expense",
  "user_id": 1,
  "item_id": 1,
  "date": "2026-03-19T14:00:00",
  "notes": null
}
```

The sign is determined by the transaction type — not by the user. This ensures consistent financial data while keeping the interface simple.

# 🔒 Privacy & Data Protection

Because this platform handles **personal financial data**, privacy and data protection are core design considerations — not afterthoughts.

The project follows principles inspired by the Brazilian **Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD)** and modern security best practices.

### Data Minimization
The system collects and stores only the information strictly necessary for the platform to function.

### Security by Design
Security is incorporated into the architecture from the beginning:
* Secure password hashing
* Protected API routes
* Authentication mechanisms
* Controlled data access

### User Data Control
Future versions will include mechanisms allowing users to manage and delete their personal data.

### Transparency
Users will have clear information about how their financial data is used within the platform.

# 🏗 Architecture

The backend follows a **layered architecture** designed to separate responsibilities and keep business rules isolated from infrastructure concerns.

```
Client
↓
Router Layer (FastAPI)
↓
Service Layer
↓
Repository Layer
↓
Domain Models
```

### Domain Models
Core business entities implemented as Python `@dataclass`. Business rules live inside the models — not scattered across services.

Key decision: **Rich Model over Anemic Model**. The `Transaction` model automatically normalizes its value on creation based on the transaction type's `is_positive` flag. The `User` model encapsulates password hashing internally. No external layer can create an inconsistent state.

Current entities:
* `User` — system user with encapsulated password hashing
* `Transaction` — financial movement with automatic value normalization
* `TransactionType` — categorizes transactions via `is_positive` business rule
* `Item` — asset or product associated with a transaction
* `ItemType` — categorizes items by type

### Repository Layer
Handles data persistence through classes that abstract the storage mechanism. Currently implemented with **in-memory storage**. Designed as classes to allow seamless migration to SQLAlchemy in Sprint 2 without changing any other layer.

### Service Layer
Contains the core business logic. Receives repositories via **dependency injection** — never instantiates them directly. Responsible for validating inputs, resolving entity relationships, and coordinating persistence.

### Router Layer
Exposes REST API endpoints using FastAPI. Uses **Pydantic schemas** to validate incoming requests and control outgoing responses. Schemas are strictly separated from Domain Models — sensitive data like passwords are never exposed in responses.

# 🌍 Long-Term Vision

The long-term goal is to evolve this backend into a **complete personal finance platform focused on social impact** — making financial management tools genuinely accessible to people who have historically been excluded from them.

This means not just building features, but building them in a way that is simple enough for anyone to use, secure enough to be trusted with sensitive financial data, and robust enough to scale to the people who need it most.

Future components include:

* A **web application** for visualizing and managing financial activity — designed for clarity and simplicity
* A **mobile application** for quick and practical expense tracking in everyday situations
* **Investment monitoring tools** for portfolio tracking over time
* **Data-driven financial insights** to help users understand their spending patterns and financial behavior
* Intelligent features powered by **data analysis and AI** to identify risky financial habits and support better decision-making

Future infrastructure includes PostgreSQL, Redis caching, Docker containerization, CI/CD pipeline, and background processing — all in service of a platform that can reach and support the people who need it most.
